## Dataset used

## Key Insights
1) Customer segmentation — Women are core customers
•	Women contribute the majority of purchases (~60+%).
•	Within women, the Adult (30–49 yrs) category is the largest contributor (~35% of sales alone), making it the highest-value segment.
Action: Create targeted product assortments, creative and promotions for women 30–49.
2) Geographic concentration — Focus states
•	Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top three states by sales. These three alone represent ~35% of total sales.
Action: Prioritize digital ad spend and marketplace promotions targeted at these states (regional language creatives, festival offers, state-specific coupon codes).
3) Channel performance — Marketplace-first approach
•	Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra together drive the bulk of revenue (~80%).
•	Smaller channels (Ajio, Meesho, Nalli) play niche roles but could be used for testing.
Action: Allocate most marketing & inventory to the top three marketplaces and run A/B tests on smaller channels for niche SKUs and pricing experiments.
4) Fulfillment health — Low returns & high delivery rate
•	Delivered rate ~94% indicates reliable fulfillment and customer satisfaction on logistics. Low return/cancel rates (~6% combined) are a strength to highlight in pitches/partnerships.
Action: Maintain fulfillment SLAs and use positive KPls (low return rate) in seller/advertising narratives.
5) Age-gender nuance — Teen and Senior opportunities
•	Teenager and Senior segments show notable female participation (Teen women ~20% and Senior women ~12.6%). While smaller than Adults, they represent clear secondary opportunities.
Action: Run small, targeted product campaigns (youth styles/promos for teenagers; comfortable/utility-focused items for seniors).
